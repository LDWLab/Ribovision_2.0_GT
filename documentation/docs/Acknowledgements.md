Our webserver would not be possible without these free resources:
- Sequences and taxonomies were retrieved from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)
- PDB identifiers are filtered through the API provided by Dr. Khanh Dao Duc and Mr. Artem Kushner through their [project for ribosomal structure analysis](https://api.ribosome.xyz/)
- RNA secondary structure diagrams - R2DT (https://rnacentral.org/r2dt) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23555-5)
- Alignment viewer – modified version of the react implementation for the [MSAViewer](https://github.com/plotly/react-msa-viewer) (10.1093/bioinformatics/btw474)
- RNA Topology Viewer – modified version of the [PDBe RNA viewer](https://github.com/PDBeurope/pdb-rna-viewer)
- FR3D  - the 3D derived base pairs annotated according to Leontis and Westhof's notation (http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/pdb/7K00/interactions/fr3d/basepairs)  
- PDB topologies provided through the [EBI PDBe REST API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/doc/topology.html)
- MolStar Viewer – [viewer](https://molstar.org/viewer/) ; [Github](https://github.com/molstar/molstar)
- Parsing of sequences and alignments and calculation of frequencies was possible thanks to the [Biopython package](https://biopython.org/)
- Sequence-alignment mapping is handled by [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/).
