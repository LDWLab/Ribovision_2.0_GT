Installation of tRNAscan-SE: a tool for finding transfer RNAs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from a source distribution, trnascan-se-2.0.0.tar.gz:
 uncompress:                gunzip trnascan-se-2.0.0.tar.gz  
 unpack:                    tar xf trnascan-se-2.0.0.tar
 move into new directory:   cd trnascan-se-2.0.0
 configure:                 ./configure
 build:                     make
 automated install:         make install

To specify a directory for installation, for example, your home
directory "/home/xyz", run configure as
 ./configure --prefix=/home/xyz
 
For more information about special parameters for running configure,
please get it at
 ./configure --help
 
tRNAscan-SE is designed to run on POSIX-compatible platforms, including
UNIX, Linux and MacOS/X. The POSIX standard essentially includes all
operating systems except Microsoft Windows. 

Non-ANSI compilers may need one or more -MDEFS defined.



Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------

tRNAscan-SE 2.0 requires separate installation of Infernal 1.1.2.
The source code and prebuilt binaries can be obtained at
http://eddylab.org/infernal/.

The installation directory of Infernal should be the same as the one
where tRNAscan-SE 2.0 is installed.
