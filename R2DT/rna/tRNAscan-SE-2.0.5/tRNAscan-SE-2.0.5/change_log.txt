v2.0.5
- Fixed code for missing tRNA predictions that only occurred when predictions were 
located within 200bp of long stretch of Ns used to connect contigs into scaffolds 
of incomplete genome assemblies

v2.0.4
- Bug fixing for incorrect position of truncated tRNA-fMet in bacterial mode
- Changed isotype and anticodon to Undet/NNN when the prediction matched with   
the tRNA-SeC convariance model but the predicted anticodon was not TCA
- Added code to allow the use of --max option for mitochondrial search mode

v2.0.3
- Added code to adjust anticodon positions for bacterial tRNA-fMet and archaeal 
tRNA-His when the sequences were misaligned with the models

v2.0.2
- Updated code to make thread option consistent with Infernal

v2.0.1
- Updated EukHighConfidenceFilter to flag tRNA-Sup as unexpected anticodon

v2.0
- Major update of tRNAscan-SE
