description "The program partitions the secondary structure space into (basepair)distance classes according to\
 two fixed reference structures. It expects a sequence and two secondary structures in dot-bracket notation as\
 its inputs. For each distance class, the MFE representative, Boltzmann probabilities and Gibbs free energy is\
 computed. Additionally, a stochastic backtracking routine allows one to produce samples of representative suboptimal\
 secondary structures from each partition\n\n"
