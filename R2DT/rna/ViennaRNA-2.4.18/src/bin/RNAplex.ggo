description "reads two RNA sequences from stdin or <filename> and\
 computes optimal and suboptimal secondary structures for their\
 hybridization. The calculation is simplified by allowing only\
 inter-molecular base pairs. Accessibility effects can be estimated by\
 RNAplex if a RNAplfold accessibility profile is provided. The\
 computed optimal and suboptimal structure are written to stdout, one\
 structure per line. Each line consist of: The structure in dot bracket\
 format with a \"&\" separating the two strands. The range of the\
 structure in the two sequences in the format  \"from,to : from,to\";\
 the energy of duplex structure in kcal/mol.\nThe format is especially\
 useful for computing the hybrid structure between a small probe\
 sequence and a long target sequence.\n"

# Options
section "Input Options"
sectiondesc="Below are command line options which alter the general input behavior of this program\n"

option "query" q
"File containing the query sequence.\n"
details="Input sequences can be given piped to RNAplex or given in a query file with the -q option.\
 Note that the -q option implies that the -t option is also used\n\n"
string
optional

option "target" t
"File containing the target sequence.\n"
details="Input sequences can be given piped to RNAplex or given in a target file with the -t option.\
 Note that the -t option implies that the -q option is also used\n\n"
string
optional

option "accessibility-dir" a
"Location of the accessibility profiles.\n"
details="This option switches the accessibility modes on and indicates in which directory accessibility\
 profiles as generated by RNAplfold can be found\n\n"
string
optional

option "binary" b
"Allow the reading and parsing of memory dumped opening energy file\n"
details="The -b option allows one to read and process opening energy files which are saved in binary format\n\
 This can reduce by a factor of 500x-1000x the time needed to process those files. RNAplex recognizes the\
 corresponding opening energy files by looking for files named after the sequence and containing the suffix\
 _openen_bin. Please look at the man page of RNAplfold if you need more information on how to produce binary\
 opening energy files.\n\n"
flag
off

option  "paramFile" P
"Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\n"
details="Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your distribution.\nSee the\
 RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. When passing the placeholder file name \"DNA\",\
 DNA parameters are loaded without the need to actually specify any input file.\n\n"

option "extension-cost" c
"Cost to add to each nucleotide in a duplex\n"
details="Cost of extending a duplex by one nucleotide. Allows one to find compact duplexes, having few/small bulges or interior loops\
 Only useful when no accessibility profiles are available. This option is disabled if accessibility profiles are used (-a option)\n\n"

optional







option "fast-folding" f
"Speedup of the target search\n"
details="This option allows one to decide if the backtracking has to be done (-f 0, -f 2) or not (-f 1). For -f 0 the structure is computed\
 based on the standard energy model. This is the slowest and most precise mode of RNAplex. With -f 2, the structure is computed based on the approximated\
 plex model. If a lot of targets are returned this is can greatly improve the runtime of RNAplex. -f 1 is the fastest mode, as no structure\
 are recomputed \n\n"
int 
default="0"
optional

option "scale-accessibility" V
"Rescale all opening energy by a factor V\n"
details="Scale-factor for the accessibility. If V is set to 1 then the scaling has no effect on the accessibility.\n\n"
double
default="1.0"
optional

option "constraint" C
"Calculate structures subject to constraints.\n"
details="The program reads first the\
 sequence, then a string containing constraints on the structure for the query sequence encoded with the symbols:\n. (no constraint\
 for this base)\n| (the corresponding base has to be paired)\n\n"
flag
off

option "alignment-mode" A
"Tells RNAplex to compute interactions based on alignments\n"
details="If the A option is set RNAplex expects clustalw files as input for the -q and -t option.\n\n"

off

option "convert-to-bin" k
"If set, RNAplex will convert all opening energy file in a directory set by the -a option into binary opening energy files\n"
details="RNAplex can be used to convert existing text formatted opening energy files into binary formatted files. In this mode RNAplex does not compute interactions.\n\n"

 good results\n\
 Smaller z leads to larger overlaps between consecutive duplexes.\n\n"
int
default="0"
optional

option "energy-threshold" e
"Minimal energy for a duplex to be returned\n"
details="Energy threshold for a duplex to be returned. The threshold is set on the total energy of interaction, i.e. the hybridization\
 energy corrected for opening energy if -a is set or the energy corrected by -c. If unset, only the mfe will be returned\n\n"
double

optional

option "produce-ps" I
"Draw an alignment annotated interaction from RNAplex\n"
details="This option allows one to produce interaction figures in PS-format a la RNAalifold, where base-pair conservation is represented in\
 color-coded format. In this mode no interaction are computed, but the -I option indicates the location of the file containing interactions\
 between two RNA (alignments/sequence) from a previous run. If the -A option is not set a structure figure a la RNAfold with color-coded annotation of the accessibilities is returned\n\n"
