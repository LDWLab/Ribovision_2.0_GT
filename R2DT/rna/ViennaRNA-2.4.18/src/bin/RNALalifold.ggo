description "reads aligned RNA sequences from stdin or file.aln and calculates\
 locally stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span. For a sequence\
 of length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and\
 O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to \"scan\" very large genomes for short RNA
 structures.\n"

 sequence in the alignment can be expressed by prepending the sequence number to the filename, \
 e.g. \"5=seq5.shape,3=seq3.shape\" will assign the reactivity values from file seq5.shape to \

 check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides in\
 any case; this is the default for mfe and partition function folding (-p).\nThe option -d0 ignores\
 dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).\nWith -d3 mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking\
 of adjacent helices in multi-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking\
 of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe folding.\n\nNote that with\
 -d1 and -d3 only the MFE computations will be using this setting while partition function uses\
