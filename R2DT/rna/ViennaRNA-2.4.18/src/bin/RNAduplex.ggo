description "reads two RNA sequences from stdin or <filename> and computes optimal\
 and suboptimal secondary structures for their hybridization. The calculation is simplified\
 by allowing only inter-molecular base pairs, for the general case use RNAcofold.\nThe computed\
 optimal and suboptimal structure are written to stdout, one structure per line. Each line consist\
 of: The structure in dot bracket format with a \"&\" separating the two strands. The range of the\
 structure in the two sequences in the format  \"from,to : from,to\"; the energy of duplex structure\
 in kcal/mol.\nThe format is especially useful for computing the hybrid structure between a small\
 probe sequence and a long target sequence.\n"

option  "noTetra" 4
"Do not include special tabulated stabilizing energies for tri-, tetra- and hexaloop hairpins. Mostly for testing.\n\n"

off

option  "dangles" d
"How to treat \"dangling end\" energies for bases adjacent to helices in free ends and multi-loops\n"
details="\nWith -d1 only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end. With -d2 this\
 check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides in\
 any case; this is the default for mfe and partition function folding (-p).\nThe option -d0 ignores\
 dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).\nWith -d3 mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking\
 of adjacent helices in multi-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking\
 of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe folding.\n\nNote that with\
 -d1 and -d3 only the MFE computations will be using this setting while partition function uses\
 -d2 setting, i.e. dangling ends will be treated differently.\n\n"

default="2"
optional

option  "noLP"  -
"Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1).\n"
details="For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur isolated. Other\
 pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.\n\n"

"Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\n"
details="Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your distribution.\nSee the\
 RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. When passing the placeholder file name \"DNA\",\
 DNA parameters are loaded without the need to actually specify any input file.\n\n"

option  "nsp" -
"Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs.\n"
details="Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the\
 first character is a \"-\" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs.\ne.g.\
 RNAfold -nsp -GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are given 0 stacking\
