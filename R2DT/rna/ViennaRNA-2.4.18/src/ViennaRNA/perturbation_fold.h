 *  @brief Find a vector of perturbation energies that minimizes the discripancies between predicted and observed pairing probabilities and the amount of neccessary adjustments
 *
 *  Use an iterative minimization algorithm to find a vector of perturbation energies whose incorporation as soft constraints shifts the predicted
 *  pairing probabilities closer to the experimentally observed probabilities.
 *  The algorithm aims to minimize an objective function that penalizes discripancies between predicted and observed pairing probabilities and energy model adjustments,
 *  i.e. an appropriate vector of perturbation energies satisfies
 *  @f[
 *  F(\vec\epsilon) = \sum_{\mu}{ \frac{\epsilon_{\mu}^2}{\tau^2} } + \sum_{i =
 *  1}^n{ \frac{(p_i(\vec\epsilon) - q_i)^2}{\sigma^2} } \to \min.
 *  @f]
 *
 *  An initialized fold compound and an array containing the observed probability for each nucleotide to be unbound are required as input data.
 *  The parameters objective_function, sigma_squared and tau_squared are responsible for adjusting the aim of the objective function.
 *  Dependend on which type of objective function is selected, either squared or absolute aberrations are contributing to the objective function.
 *  The ratio of the parameters sigma_squared and tau_squared can be used to adjust the algorithm to find a solution either close to the thermodynamic prediction
 *  (sigma_squared >> tau_squared) or close to the experimental data (tau_squared >> sigma_squared).
 *  The minimization can be performed by makeing use of a custom gradient descent implementation or using one of the minimizing algorithms provided by the GNU Scientific Library.
 *  All algorithms require the evaluation of the gradient of the objective function, which includes the evaluation of conditional pairing probabilites.
 *  Since an exact evaluation is expensive, the probabilities can also be estimated from sampling by setting an appropriate sample size.
 *  The found vector of perturbation energies will be stored in the array epsilon.
 *  The progress of the minimization process can be tracked by implementing and passing a callback function.
