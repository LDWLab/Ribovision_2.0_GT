 *  @brief  Variations of the local (sliding window) Minimum Free Energy (MFE) prediction algorithm
 *
 *  We provide implementations for the local (sliding window) MFE prediction algorithm for
 *  * Single sequences,
 *  * Multiple sequence alignments (MSA), and
 *
 *  Note, that our implementation scans an RNA sequence (or MSA) from the 3' to the 5'
 *  end, and reports back locally optimal (consensus) structures, the corresponding free
 *  energy, and the position of the sliding window in global coordinates.
 *
 *  For any particular RNA sequence (or MSA) multiple locally optimal (consensus)
 *  secondary structures may be predicted. Thus, we tried to implement an interface that
 *  allows for an effortless conversion of the corresponding hits into any target data
 *  structure. As a consequence, we provide two distinct ways to retrieve the corresponding
 *  predictions, either
 *  * through directly writing to an open @p FILE stream on-the-fly, or
 *  * through a callback function mechanism.
 *
 *  The latter allows one to store the results in any possible target data structure. Our
 *  implementations then pass the results through the user-implemented callback as soon as
 *  the prediction for a particular window is finished.
