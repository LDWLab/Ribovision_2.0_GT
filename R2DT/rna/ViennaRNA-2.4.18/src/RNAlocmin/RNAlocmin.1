options, and exit

.SS "General options:"
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-seq\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Sequence file in FASTA format. If the sequence is
the first line of the input file, this is not
needed  (default=`seq.txt')
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-previous\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Previously found LM (output from RNAlocmin or
barriers), if specified does not need \fB\-\-seq\fR
option
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-move\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Move set:
I ==> insertion & deletion of base pairs
S ==> I&D& switch of base pairs  (possible
values="I", "S" default=`I')
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-min\-num\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Maximal number of local minima returned
(0 == unlimited)  (default=`100000')
.TP
\fB\-\-find\-num\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Maximal number of local minima found
(default = unlimited \- crawl through whole input
file)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\-lvl\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Level of verbosity (0 = nothing, 4 = full)
WARNING: higher verbose levels increase the
computation time  (default=`0')
.TP
\fB\-\-depth\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Depth of findpath search (higher value increases
running time linearly)  (default=`10')
.TP
\fB\-\-minh\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Print only minima with energy barrier greater than
this  (default=`0.0')
.TP
\fB\-\-minh\-lite\fR
When flooding with \fB\-\-minh\fR option, search for only
saddle (do not search for a LM that is lower).
Increases efficiency a tiny bit, but when turned
on, the results may omit some non\-shallow
minima, especially with higher \fB\-\-minh\fR value.
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-walk\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Walking method used
D ==> gradient descent
F ==> use first found lower energy structure
R ==> use random lower energy structure (does
not work with \fB\-\-noLP\fR and \fB\-m\fR S options)
(possible values="D", "F", "R"
default=`D')
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Work only with canonical RNA structures (w/o
isolated base pairs, cannot be combined with
ranodm walk (\fB\-w\fR R option) and shift move set (\fB\-m\fR
S))  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-useEOS\fR
Use energy_of_structure_pt calculation instead of
energy_of_move (slower, it should not affect
results)  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is the default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition
function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-fix\-barriers\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Fix barrier file for interior loops (just
recompute if all LM in barrier output are LM),
if specified, does not need neither \fB\-\-previous\fR
nor \fB\-\-seq\fR option
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-pseudoknots\fR
Allow for pseudoknots according to "gfold" model
\- H, K, L, and M types (genus one) of
pseudoknots are allowed (increases computation
time greatly), cannot be combined with shift
move set (\fB\-m\fR S)  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-just\-read\fR
Do not expect input from stdin, just do
postprocessing.  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-neighborhood\fR
Use the Neighborhood routines to perform gradient
descend. Cannot be combined with shift move set
(\fB\-m\fR S) and pseudoknots (\fB\-k\fR). Test option.
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-degeneracy\-off\fR
Do not deal with degeneracy, select the
lexicographically first from the same energy
neighbors.  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-just\-output\fR
Do not store the minima and optimize, just compute
directly minima and output them. Output file can
contain duplicates.  (default=off)
.SS "Barrier tree:"

\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bartree\fR
Generate an approximate barrier tree.
(default=off)
.TP

output format of barriers program)

\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Temperature in Celsius (only for rates)
(default=`37.0')
.SS "Flooding parameters (flooding occurs only with -r, -b, or --minh option):"
.TP
\fB\-\-floodPortion\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Fraction of minima to flood (floods first minima
with low number of inwalking sample structures)
(0.0 \-> no flood; 1.0 \-> try to flood all)
Usable only with \fB\-r\fR or \fB\-b\fR options.
(default=`0.95')
.TP
\fB\-\-floodMax\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Flood cap \- how many structures to flood in one
basin  (default=`1000')

Number of intervals for Jing's visualisation
(default=`0')
.TP
\fB\-\-eRange\fR=\fI\,FLOAT\/\fR

lowest found LM), MFE+eRange> in kcal/mol.
.TP
\fB\-\-allegiance\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Filename where to output the allegiance of
structures. Works properly only with RNAsubopt
\fB\-e\fR list.
