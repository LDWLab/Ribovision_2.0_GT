First make sure that you have ViennaRNA package installed and that paths in Makefile: 

"ViennaRNA" points to header files ("H" directory in ViennaRNA)
"ViennaLIB" points to "libRNA.a" library

Then make sure you have "gengetopt" installed and your g++ compiler supports c++11 standard.
Then simple "make" should do it.
