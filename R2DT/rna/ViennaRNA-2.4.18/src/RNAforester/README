This is Version 2.0 of the RNAforester package.
------------------------------------------------

The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures
and it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the
Vienna RNA package (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/).

RNAforester can:
- calculate a global alignment of RNA secondary structures
- calculate a local alignments (local similarity) of RNA secondary structures
- calculate multiple alignments of RNA secondary structures
- visualize RNA secondary structure alignments as 2d plots

The package should be easily portable. It is known to compile without
modifications at least under Solaris, MacOS, and Linux.
Other UN*X flavours should present no problems.
You need a compiler that understands standard C++.
See the INSTALL file for details.
For more details about RNAforester see the man page.

The most recent source code and documentation should always be available on
the web at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnaforester
