[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] [\fI\,<input0>\/\fR] [\fI\,<input1>\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAeval 2.4.18
.PP
Determine the free energy of a (consensus) secondary structure for (an
alignment of) RNA sequence(s)
.PP
Evaluates the free energy of a particular (consensus) secondary structure for
an (an alignment of) RNA molecule(s). The energy unit is kcal/mol and contains
a covariance pseudo\-energy term for multiple sequence alignments (\fB\-\-msa\fR option)
and corresponding consensus structures.
The program will continue to read new sequences and structures until a line
consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition is
encountered.
If the input sequence or structure contains the separator character "&" the
program calculates the energy of the co\-folding of two RNA strands, where the
"&" marks the boundary between the two strands.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print out energy contribution of each loop in
the structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=\fI\,number\/\fR]
Split batch input into jobs and start
processing in parallel using multiple
threads. A value of 0 indicates to use as
many parallel threads as computation cores
are available.
.IP
(default=`0')
.IP
Default processing of input data is performed in a serial fashion, i.e. one
sequence at a time. Using this switch, a user can instead start the
computation for many sequences in the input in parallel. RNAeval will create
as many parallel computation slots as specified and assigns input sequences
of the input file(s) to the available slots. Note, that this increases memory
consumption since input alignments have to be kept in memory until an empty
compute slot is available and each running job requires its own dynamic
programming matrices.
.TP
\fB\-\-unordered\fR
Do not try to keep output in order with input
while parallel processing is in place.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
When parallel input processing (\fB\-\-jobs\fR flag) is enabled, the order in which
input is processed depends on the host machines job scheduler. Therefore, any
output to stdout or files generated by this program will most likely not
follow the order of the corresponding input data set. The default of RNAeval
is to use a specialized data structure to still keep the results output in
order with the input data. However, this comes with a trade\-off in terms of
memory consumption, since all output must be kept in memory for as long as no
chunks of consecutive, ordered output are available. By setting this flag,
RNAeval will not buffer individual results but print them as soon as they
have been computated.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-infile=\fR<filename>
Read a file instead of reading from stdin
.IP
The default behavior of RNAeval is to read input from stdin or the file(s)
that follow(s) the RNAeval command. Using this parameter the user can specify
input file names where data is read from. Note, that any additional files
supplied to RNAeval are still processed as well.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-msa\fR
Input is multiple sequence alignment in
Stockholm 1.0 format
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Using this flag indicates that the input is a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) instead of (a) single sequence(s). Note, that only STOCKHOLM format
allows one to specify a consensus structure. Therefore, this is the only
supported MSA format for now!
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNAeval is to automatically determine an ID from the
input sequence data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs
are usually given in the FASTA header of input sequences. If this flag is
active, RNAeval ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and automatically
generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an
increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the
output even if the input has none.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,prefix\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names)
.IP
(default=`sequence')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each sequence will be prefixed with the provided
string. Note: Setting this parameter implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiter between prefix and
increasing number for automatically generated
IDs (as used in output file names)
.IP
(default=`_')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the default delimiter "_" between
.IP
the prefix string and the increasing number for automatically generated ID.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18]. This option implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies to ignore any IDs retrieved from the
input data, i.e. it activates the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR flag.
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end.
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for mfe
and partition function folding.
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. When passing the
placeholder file name "DNA", DNA parameters are loaded without the need to
actually specify any input file.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circ\fR
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA
molecule.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-logML\fR
Recalculate energies of structures using a
logarithmic energy function for multi\-loops
before output.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
This option does not effect structure generation, only the energies that are
printed out. Since logML lowers energies somewhat, some structures may be
missing.
.TP
\fB\-\-shape\fR=\fI\,SHAPE\/\fR file
Use SHAPE reactivity data in the folding
recursions (does not work for PF yet)
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,[D\/\fR/Z/W] + [optional parameters]
Specify the method how to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivity data to pseudo energy
contributions
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into pseudo
energy contributions.
.IP
\&'D': Convert by using a linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009. The
calculated pseudo energies will be applied for every nucleotide involved in a
stacked pair. This method is recognized by a capital 'D' in the provided
parameter, i.e.: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting. The slope 'm'
and the intercept 'b' can be set to a non\-default value if necessary,
otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6. To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7,
use a parameter string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also
provide only one of the two parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.IP
\&'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam
et al 2012. SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by
using linear mapping. Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will
be penalized during the folding recursion. The magnitude of the penalties can
affected by adjusting the factor beta (e.g. \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Zb0.8").
.IP
\&'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides
according to Washietl et al 2012. Perturbation vectors can be calculated by
using RNApvmin.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeConversion\fR=\fI\,M\/\fR/C/S/L/O
+ [optional parameters]
Specify the method used to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivities to pairing probabilities when
using the SHAPE approach of Zarringhalam et
al.
.IP
(default=`O')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into the
probability for a certain nucleotide to be unpaired.
.IP
\&'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
\&'C': Use a cutoff\-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides
(e.g. "C0.25")
\&'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents
probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
\&'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for
being unpaired (e.g. "Ls0.68i0.2" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept
of 0.2)
\&'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a
probability for being unpaired (e.g. "Os1.6i\-2.29" to use a slope of 1.6
and an intercept of \fB\-2\fR.29)
.TP
\fB\-\-mis\fR
Output "most informative sequence" instead of
simple consensus: For each column of the
alignment output the set of nucleotides with
frequency greater than average in IUPAC
notation.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-cfactor\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the weight of the covariance term in the
energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-\-nfactor\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in
the covariance term of the energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_file\fR=\fI\,ribosumfile\/\fR
use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal
.TP
energy model. Matrixes to use should be 6x6
matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG,
GC, GU, UA, UG.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_scoring\fR
use ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is
chosen according to the minimal and maximal
pairwise identities of the sequences in the
file.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-old\fR
use old energy evaluation, treating gaps as
characters.
.IP
(default=off)
