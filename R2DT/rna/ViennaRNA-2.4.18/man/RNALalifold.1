.SH DESCRIPTION
RNALalifold 2.4.18
.PP
calculate locally stable secondary structures for a set of aligned RNAs
.PP
reads aligned RNA sequences from stdin or file.aln and calculates locally
stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span. For a sequence of
length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and
O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to "scan" very large genomes for
short RNA

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Command line options which alter the general behavior of this program
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Be quiet.
(default=off)
.IP
This option can be used to minimize the output of additional information and
non\-severe warnings which otherwise might spam stdout/stderr.
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitute nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-input\-format\fR=\fI\,C\/\fR|S|F|M
File format of the input multiple sequence
alignment (MSA).
.IP
If this parameter is set, the input is considered to be in a particular file
format. Otherwise, the program tries to determine the file format
automatically, if an input file was provided in the set of parameters. In
case the input MSA is provided in interactive mode, or from a terminal (TTY),
the programs default is to assume CLUSTALW format.
Currently, the following formats are available: ClustalW (C), Stockholm 1.0
(S), FASTA/Pearson (F), and MAF (M).
.TP
\fB\-\-csv\fR
Create comma separated output (csv)
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\fR[=\fI\,prefix\/\fR]
Produce output alignments and secondary
structure plots for each hit found.
.IP
This option tells the program to produce, for each hit, a colored and
structure annotated (sub)alignment and secondary structure plot in PostScript
format. It also adds the subalignment hit into a multi\-Stockholm formatted
file "RNALalifold_results.stk". The postscript output file names are
"aln_start_end.eps" and "ss_start_end.eps". All files will be created in
the current directory. The optional argument string can be used to set a
specific prefix that is used to name the output files. The file names then
become "prefix_aln_start_end.eps", "prefix_ss_start_end.eps", and
"prefix.stk". Note: Any special characters in the prefix will be replaced
by the filename delimiter, hence there is no way to pass an entire directory
path through this option yet. (See also the "\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-EPS\fR[=\fI\,prefix\/\fR]
Produce colored and structure annotated
subalignment for each hit
.IP
The default file name used for the output is "aln_start_end.eps" where
"start" and "end" denote the first and last column of the subalignment
relative to the input (1\-based). Users may change the filename to
"prefix_aln_start_end.eps" by specifying the prefix as optional argument.
Files will be create in the current directory. Note: Any special characters
in the prefix will be replaced by the filename delimiter, hence there is no
way to pass an entire directory path through this option yet. (See also the
"\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-EPS\-cols\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Number of columns in colored EPS alignment
output.
.IP
(default=`60')
.IP
A value less than 1 indicates that the output should not be wrapped at all.
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-EPS\-ss\fR[=\fI\,prefix\/\fR]
Produce colored consensus secondary structure
plots in PostScript format
.IP
The default file name used for the output is "ss_start_end.eps" where
"start" and "end" denote the first and last column of the subalignment
relative to the input (1\-based). Users may change the filename to
"prefix_ss_start_end.eps" by specifying the prefix as optional argument.
Files will be create in the current directory. Note: Any special characters
in the prefix will be replaced by the filename delimiter, hence there is no
way to pass an entire directory path through this option yet. (See also the
"\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-stk\fR[=\fI\,prefix\/\fR]
Add hits to a multi\-Stockholm formatted output
file.
.IP
(default=`RNALalifold_results')
.IP
The default file name used for the output is "RNALalifold_results.stk".
Users may change the filename to "prefix.stk" by specifying the prefix as
optional argument. The file will be create in the current directory if it
does not already exist. In case the file already exists, output will be
appended to it. Note: Any special characters in the prefix will be replaced
by the filename delimiter, hence there is no way to pass an entire directory
path through this option yet. (See also the "\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each
alignment.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNALalifold is to automatically determine an ID from the
input alignment if the input file format allows to do that. Alignment IDs
are, for instance, usually given in Stockholm 1.0 formatted input. If this
flag is active, RNALalifold ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and
automatically generates an ID for each alignment.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,prefix\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names)
.IP
(default=`alignment')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each alignment will be prefixed with the provided
string. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming scheme:
"prefix_xxxx_ss.ps" (secondary structure plot), "prefix_xxxx_dp.ps"
(dot\-plot), "prefix_xxxx_aln.ps" (annotated alignment), etc. where xxxx is
the alignment number beginning with the second alignment in the input. Use
this setting in conjunction with the \fB\-\-continuous\-ids\fR flag to assign IDs
beginning with the first input alignment.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiter between prefix and
increasing number for automatically generated
IDs (as used in output file names)
.IP
(default=`_')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the default delimiter "_" between
.IP
the prefix string and the increasing number for automatically generated ID.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18].
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
When alignment IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies continuous alignment IDs, i.e. it
activates the \fB\-\-continuous\-ids\fR flag.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiting character that is used
.IP
for sanitized filenames
.IP
(default=`ID\-delimiter')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while
sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the
default delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the "ID delimiter" as
supplied through the \fB\-\-id\-delim\fR option. If the delimiter is a whitespace
character or empty, invalid characters will be simply removed rather than
substituted. Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use
in filenames: backslash '\e', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%',
asterisk '*', colon ':', pipe symbol '|', double quote '"', triangular
brackets '<' and '>'.
.TP
\fB\-\-split\-contributions\fR
Split the free energy contributions into
separate parts
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
By default, only the total energy contribution for each hit is returned.
Using this option, this contribution is split into individual parts, i.e. the
Nearest Neighbor model energy, the covariance pseudo energy, and if
applicable, a remaining pseudo energy derived from special constraints, such
as probing signals like SHAPE.
.SS "Structure Constraints:"
.IP
Command line options to interact with the structure constraints feature of
this program
.TP
\fB\-\-shape\fR=\fI\,file1\/\fR,file2
Use SHAPE reactivity data to guide structure
predictions
.IP
Multiple shapefiles for the individual sequences in the alignment may be
specified  as a comma separated list. An optional association of particular
shape files to a specific  sequence in the alignment can be expressed by
prepending the sequence number to the filename,  e.g.
"5=seq5.shape,3=seq3.shape" will assign the reactivity values from file
seq5.shape to  the fifth sequence in the alignment, and the values from file
seq3.shape to sequence 3. If  no assignment is specified, the reactivity
values are assigned to corresponding sequences in  the order they are given.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,D[mX][bY]\/\fR
Specify the method how to convert SHAPE
reactivity data to pseudo energy
contributions
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
Currently, the only data conversion method available is that of to Deigan et
al 2009.  This method is the default and is recognized by a capital 'D' in
the provided parameter, i.e.:  \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting.
The slope 'm' and the intercept 'b' can be set to a  non\-default value if
necessary. Otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6 as stated in the paper mentionen
before.  To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7, use a  parameter
string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also provide only one
of the two  parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-maxBPspan\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Set the maximum allowed separation of a base
pair to span. I.e. no pairs (i,j) with
j\-i>span will be allowed.
.IP
(default=`70')
.TP
\fB\-\-threshold\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Energy threshold in kcal/mol per nucleotide
above which secondary structure hits are
omitted in the output.
.IP
(default=`\-0.1')
.TP
\fB\-\-mis\fR
Output "most informative sequence" instead of
simple consensus: For each column of the
alignment output the set of nucleotides with
frequency greater than average in IUPAC
notation.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end.
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for mfe
and partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR only the MFE computations will be using this
setting while partition function uses \fB\-d2\fR setting, i.e. dangling ends will be
treated differently.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. When passing the
placeholder file name "DNA", DNA parameters are loaded without the need to
actually specify any input file.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-cfactor\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the weight of the covariance term in the
energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-\-nfactor\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in
the covariance term of the energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_file\fR=\fI\,ribosumfile\/\fR
use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal
.TP
energy model. Matrixes to use should be 6x6
matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG,
GC, GU, UA, UG.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_scoring\fR
use ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is
chosen according to the minimal and maximal
pairwise identities of the sequences in the
file.
.IP
(default=off)
