.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAalifold 2.4.18
.PP
calculate secondary structures for a set of aligned RNAs
.PP
Read aligned RNA sequences from stdin or file.aln and calculate their minimum
free energy (mfe) structure, partition function (pf) and base pairing
probability matrix. Currently, input alignments have to be in CLUSTAL,
Stockholm, FASTA, or MAF format. The input format must be set manually in
interactive mode (default is Clustal), but will be determined automagically
from the input file, if not expplicitly set. It returns the mfe structure in
bracket notation, its energy, the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble and
the frequency of the mfe structure in the ensemble to stdout.  It also produces
Postscript files with plots of the resulting secondary structure graph
("alirna.ps") and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix ("alidot.ps").
The file "alifold.out" will contain a list of likely pairs sorted by
credibility, suitable for viewing  with "AliDot.pl". Be warned that output
file will overwrite any existing files of the same name.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Command line options which alter the general behavior of this program
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Be quiet.
(default=off)
.IP
This option can be used to minimize the output of additional information and
non\-severe warnings which otherwise might spam stdout/stderr.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=\fI\,number\/\fR]
Split batch input into jobs and start
processing in parallel using multiple
threads. A value of 0 indicates to use as
many parallel threads as computation cores
are available.
.IP
(default=`0')
.IP
Default processing of input data is performed in a serial fashion, i.e. one
alignment at a time. Using this switch, a user can instead start the
computation for many alignments in the input in parallel. RNAalifold will
create as many parallel computation slots as specified and assigns input
alignments of the input file(s) to the available slots. Note, that this
increases memory consumption since input alignments have to be kept in memory
until an empty compute slot is available and each running job requires its
own dynamic programming matrices.
.TP
\fB\-\-unordered\fR
Do not try to keep output in order with input
while parallel processing is in place.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
When parallel input processing (\fB\-\-jobs\fR flag) is enabled, the order in which
input is processed depends on the host machines job scheduler. Therefore, any
output to stdout or files generated by this program will most likely not
follow the order of the corresponding input data set. The default of
RNAalifold is to use a specialized data structure to still keep the results
output in order with the input data. However, this comes with a trade\-off in
terms of memory consumption, since all output must be kept in memory for as
long as no chunks of consecutive, ordered output are available. By setting
this flag, RNAalifold will not buffer individual results but print them as
soon as they have been computated.
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitute nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR
Produce a colored version of the consensus
structure plot "alirna.ps" (default b&w
only)
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\fR
Produce a colored and structure annotated
alignment in PostScript format in the file
"aln.ps" in the current directory.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-EPS\-cols\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Number of columns in colored EPS alignment
output.
.IP
(default=`60')
.IP
A value less than 1 indicates that the output should not be wrapped at all.
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-stk\fR[=\fI\,prefix\/\fR]
Create a multi\-Stockholm formatted output file.
(default=`RNAalifold_results')
.IP
The default file name used for the output is "RNAalifold_results.stk".
Users may change the filename to "prefix.stk" by specifying the prefix as
optional argument. The file will be create in the current directory if it
does not already exist. In case the file already exists, output will be
appended to it. Note: Any special characters in the filename will be replaced
by the filename delimiter, hence there is no way to pass an entire directory
path through this option yet. (See also the "\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-layout\-type\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Choose the layout algorithm. Simple radial
layout if 0, or naview if 1
.IP
(default=`1')
.TP
\fB\-\-noPS\fR
Do not produce postscript drawing of the mfe
structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noDP\fR
Do not produce dot\-plot postscript file
containing base pair or stack
probabilitities.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
In combination with the \fB\-p\fR option, this flag turns\-off creation of individual
dot\-plot files. Consequently, computed base pair probability output is
omitted but centroid and MEA structure prediction is still performed.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-input\-format\fR=\fI\,C\/\fR|S|F|M
File format of the input multiple sequence
alignment (MSA).
.IP
If this parameter is set, the input is considered to be in a particular file
format. Otherwise, the program tries to determine the file format
automatically, if an input file was provided in the set of parameters. In
case the input MSA is provided in interactive mode, or from a terminal (TTY),
the programs default is to assume CLUSTALW format.
Currently, the following formats are available: ClustalW (C), Stockholm 1.0
(S), FASTA/Pearson (F), and MAF (M).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-continuous\-ids\fR
Use continuous alignment ID numbering when no
alignment ID can be retrieved from input
data.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Due to its past, RNAalifold produces a specific set of output file names for
the first input alignment, "alirna.ps", "alidot.ps", etc. But for all
further alignments in the input, it usually adopts a naming scheme based on
IDs, which may be retrieved from the input alignment's meta\-data, or
generated by a prefix followed by an increasing counter. Setting this flag
instructs RNAalifold to use the ID naming scheme also for the first
alignment.
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each
alignment.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNAalifold is to automatically determine an ID from the
input alignment if the input file format allows to do that. Alignment IDs
are, for instance, usually given in Stockholm 1.0 formatted input. If this
flag is active, RNAalifold ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and
automatically generates an ID for each alignment.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,prefix\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names)
.IP
(default=`alignment')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each alignment will be prefixed with the provided
string. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming scheme:
"prefix_xxxx_ss.ps" (secondary structure plot), "prefix_xxxx_dp.ps"
(dot\-plot), "prefix_xxxx_aln.ps" (annotated alignment), etc. where xxxx is
the alignment number beginning with the second alignment in the input. Use
this setting in conjunction with the \fB\-\-continuous\-ids\fR flag to assign IDs
beginning with the first input alignment.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiter between prefix and
increasing number for automatically generated
IDs (as used in output file names)
.IP
(default=`_')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the default delimiter "_" between
.IP
the prefix string and the increasing number for automatically generated ID.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18].
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
When alignment IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies continuous alignment IDs, i.e. it
activates the \fB\-\-continuous\-ids\fR flag.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiting character that is used
.IP
for sanitized filenames
.IP
(default=`ID\-delimiter')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while
sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the
default delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the "ID delimiter" as
supplied through the \fB\-\-id\-delim\fR option. If the delimiter is a whitespace
character or empty, invalid characters will be simply removed rather than
substituted. Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use
in filenames: backslash '\e', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%',
asterisk '*', colon ':', pipe symbol '|', double quote '"', triangular
brackets '<' and '>'.
.SS "Structure Constraints:"
.IP
Command line options to interact with the structure constraints feature of
this program
.TP
\fB\-\-maxBPspan\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Set the maximum base pair span
.IP
(default=`\-1')
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint[=\fR<filename>] Calculate structures subject to constraints.
The constraining structure will be read from
\&'stdin', the alignment has to be given as a
file name on the command line.
.IP
(default=`')
.IP
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints on
the structure encoded with the symbols:
.IP
\&. (no constraint for this base)
.IP
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
.IP
x (the base is unpaired)
.IP
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
.IP
\f(CW> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\fR
.IP
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
.IP
With the exception of "|", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting
with the constraint. This is usually sufficient to enforce the constraint,
but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF folding
ignores constraints of type "|".
.TP
\fB\-\-batch\fR
Use constraints for all alignment records.
(default=off)
.IP
Usually, constraints provided from input file are only applied to a single
sequence alignment. Therefore, RNAalifold will stop its computation and quit
after the first input alignment was processed. Using this switch, RNAalifold
processes all sequence alignments in the input and applies the same provided
constraints to each of them.
.TP
\fB\-\-enforceConstraint\fR
Enforce base pairs given by round brackets ( )
in structure constraint
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-SS_cons\fR
Use consensus structures from Stockholm file
(#=GF SS_cons) as constraint
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Stockholm formatted alignment files have the possibility to store a secondary
structure string in one of if ("#=GC") column annotation meta tags. The
corresponding tag name is usually "SS_cons", a consensus secondary
structure. Activating this flag allows one to use this consensus secondary
structure from the input file as structure constraint. Currently, only the
following characters are interpreted:
.IP
( ) [mathing parenthesis: column i pairs with column j]
.IP
< > [matching angular brackets: column i pairs with column j]
.IP
All other characters are not interpreted (yet).
Note: Activating this flag implies \fB\-\-constraint\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-shape\fR=\fI\,file1\/\fR,file2
Use SHAPE reactivity data to guide structure
predictions
.IP
Multiple shapefiles for the individual sequences in the alignment may be
specified  as a comma separated list. An optional association of particular
shape files to a specific  sequence in the alignment can be expressed by
prepending the sequence number to the filename,  e.g.
"5=seq5.shape,3=seq3.shape" will assign the reactivity values from file
seq5.shape to  the fifth sequence in the alignment, and the values from file
seq3.shape to sequence 3. If  no assignment is specified, the reactivity
values are assigned to corresponding sequences in  the order they are given.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,D[mX][bY]\/\fR
Specify the method how to convert SHAPE
reactivity data to pseudo energy
contributions
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
Currently, the only data conversion method available is that of to Deigan et
al 2009.  This method is the default and is recognized by a capital 'D' in
the provided parameter, i.e.:  \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting.
The slope 'm' and the intercept 'b' can be set to a  non\-default value if
necessary. Otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6 as stated in the paper mentionen
before.  To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7, use a  parameter
string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also provide only one
of the two  parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partfunc\fR[=\fI\,INT\/\fR]
Calculate the partition function and base
pairing probability matrix in addition to the
mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe
structure only.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
In addition to the MFE structure we print a coarse representation of the pair
probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by the ensemble
free energy, as well as the centroid structure derived from the pair
probabilities together with its free energy and distance to the ensemble.
Finally it prints the frequency of the mfe structure.
.IP
An additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior of partition
function calculation:
\fB\-p0\fR deactivates the calculation of the pair probabilities, saving about 50%
in runtime. This prints the ensemble free energy \fB\-kT\fR ln(Z).
.TP
\fB\-\-MEA\fR[=\fI\,gamma\/\fR]
Calculate an MEA (maximum expected accuracy)
structure, where the expected accuracy is
computed from the pair probabilities: each
base pair (i,j) gets a score 2*gamma*p_ij and
the score of an unpaired base is given by the
probability of not forming a pair.
.IP
(default=`1.')
.IP
The parameter gamma tunes the importance of correctly predicted pairs versus
unpaired bases. Thus, for small values of gamma the MEA structure will
contain only pairs with very high probability.
Using \fB\-\-MEA\fR implies \fB\-p\fR for computing the pair probabilities.
.TP
\fB\-\-mis\fR
Output "most informative sequence" instead of
simple consensus: For each column of the
alignment output the set of nucleotides with
frequency greater than average in IUPAC
notation.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stochBT\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Stochastic backtrack. Compute a certain number
of random structures with a probability
dependend on the partition function. See \fB\-p\fR
option in RNAsubopt.
.TP
\fB\-\-stochBT_en\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
same as "\-s" but also print out the energies
and probabilities of the backtraced
structures.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-nonRedundant\fR
Enable non\-redundant sampling strategy.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-pfScale\fR=\fI\,scaling\/\fR factor
In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as
an estimate for the ensemble free energy
(used to avoid overflows).
.IP
The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for
long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README
file).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circ\fR
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA
molecule.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-bppmThreshold=\fR<value>
Set the threshold for base pair probabilities
included in the postscript output
.IP
(default=`1e\-6')
.IP
By setting the threshold the base pair probabilities that are included in the
output can be varied. By default only those exceeding 1e\-5 in probability
will be shown as squares in the dot plot. Changing the threshold to any other
value allows for increase or decrease of data.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-sci\fR
Compute the structure conservation index (SCI)
for the MFE consensus structure of the
alignment
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Mostly for testing.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on
both sides
.IP
in any case.
.IP
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-cfactor\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the weight of the covariance term in the
energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-\-nfactor\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in
the covariance term of the energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-endgaps\fR
Score pairs with endgaps same as gap\-gap pairs.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_file\fR=\fI\,ribosumfile\/\fR
use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal
.TP
energy model. Matrixes to use should be 6x6
matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG,
GC, GU, UA, UG.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_scoring\fR
use ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is
chosen according to the minimal and maximal
pairwise identities of the sequences in the
file.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-old\fR
use old energy evaluation, treating gaps as
characters.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. When passing the
placeholder file name "DNA", DNA parameters are loaded without the need to
actually specify any input file.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-betaScale\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the scaling of the Boltzmann factors
(default=`1.')
.IP
The argument provided with this option enables to scale the thermodynamic
temperature used in the Boltzmann factors independently from the temperature
used to scale the individual energy contributions of the loop types. The
Boltzmann factors then become exp(\fB\-dG\fR/(kTn*betaScale)) where k is the
Boltzmann constant, dG the free energy contribution of the state, T the
absolute temperature and n the number of sequences.
.PP
Caveats:
.PP
Sequences are not weighted. If possible, do not mix very similar and dissimilar
sequences. Duplicate sequences, for example, can distort the prediction.

Here, the first line is written to \fIstderr\fR and simply states the number of sequences and
the length of the alignment. This line can be suppressed using the \fB\-\-quiet\fR option.
The main output then consists of 7 lines, where the first two resemble the FASTA header
with the ID as read from the input data set, followed by the consensus sequence in the
second line. The third line consists of the consensus secondary structure in dot-bracket
notation followed by the averaged minimum free energy in parenthesis. This energy is
composed of two major contributions, the actual free energies derived from the Nearest
Neighbor model, and the covariance pseudo-energy term, which are both displayed after
the equal sign. The fourth line shows the base pair propensity in pseudo dot-bracket
notation followed by the ensemble free energy dG = -kT ln(Z) in square brackets.
Similarly, the next two lines state the controid- and the MEA structure in dot-bracket
notation, followed by their corresponding free energy contributions, the mean distance
(d) to the ensemble as well as the maximum expected accuracy (MEA). Again, the free
energies are split into Nearest Neighbor contribution and the covariance pseudo-energy
term.

Furthermore, RNAalifold will produce three output files: ACA59_ss.ps, ACA59_dp.ps, and
ACA59_ali.out that contain the secondary structure drawing, the base pair probability
dot-plot, and a detailed table of base pair probabilities, respectively.


.SH "THE ALIOUT FILE"

When computing base pair probabilities (\fB\-\-partfunc\fR option), RNAalifold will produce
a file with the suffix `ali.out`. This file contains the base pairing probabilities between
different alignment columns together with some detailed statistics for the individual
sequences within the alignment. The file is a simple text file with a two line header that
states the number of sequences and length of the alignment. The first couple of lines
of this file may look like:

.nf

Starting with the third row, there are at least six and at most 13 columns separated by
whitespaces stating: (1) the i-position and (2) the j-position of a potential base pair
(i, j), followed by (3) the number of counter examples, i.e. the number of sequences in
the alignment that can't form a canonical base pair with their respective sequence positions.
Next is (4) the base pair probabilitiy in percent, (5) a pseudo entropy measure
S_ij = S_i + S_j - p_ij ln(p_ij), where S_i and S_j are the positional entropies for the
two alignment columns i and j, and p_ij is the base pair probability. Finally, the last
columns (6-12) state the number of particular base pairs for the individual sequences in
the alignment. Here, we distinguish the base pairs "GC","CG","AU","UA","GU","UG", and
the special case "\-\-" that represents gaps at both positions i and j.
Finally, base pairs that are not part of the MFE structure are marked by an additional
"+" sign in the last column.
