.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAplot 2.4.18
.PP
Draw RNA Secondary Structures
.PP
The program reads (aligned) RNA sequences and structures in the format as
produced by RNAfold or Stockholm 1.0 and produces drawings of the secondary
structure graph.
Coordinates for the structure graphs are produced using either E. Bruccoleri's
naview routines, or a simple radial layout method.
For aligned sequences and consensus structures (\fB\-\-msa\fR option) the graph may be
annotated by covariance information. Additionally, a color\-annotated EPS
alignment figure can be produced, similar to that obtained by RNAalifold and
RNALalifold.
If the sequence was preceded by a FASTA header, or if the multiple sequence
alignment contains an ID field, these IDs will be taken as names for the output
file(s): "name_ss.ps" and "name_aln.ps". Otherwise "rna.ps" and
"aln.ps" will be used. This behavior may be over\-ruled by explicitly setting
a filename prefix using the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR option.
Existing files of the same name will be overwritten.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-detailed\-help\fR
Print help, including all details and hidden
options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-full\-help\fR
Print help, including hidden options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=\fI\,number\/\fR]
Split batch input into jobs and start
processing in parallel using multiple
threads.  (default=`0')
.IP
Default processing of input data is performed in a serial fashion, i.e. one
sequence at a time. Using this switch, a user can instead start the
computation for many sequences in the input in parallel. RNAplot will create
as many parallel computation slots as specified and assigns input sequences
of the input file(s) to the available slots. Note, that this increases memory
consumption since input alignments have to be kept in memory until an empty
compute slot is available and each running job requires its own dynamic
programming matrices. A value of 0 indicates to use as many parallel threads
as computation cores are available.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-infile=\fR<filename>
Read a file instead of reading from stdin.
.IP
The default behavior of RNAplot is to read input from stdin or the file(s)
that follow(s) the RNAplot command. Using this parameter the user can specify
input file names where data is read from. Note, that any additional files
supplied to RNAplot are still processed as well.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-msa\fR
Input is multiple sequence alignment in
Stockholm 1.0 format.  (default=off)
.IP
Using this flag indicates that the input is a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) instead of (a) single sequence(s). Note, that only STOCKHOLM format
allows one to specify a consensus structure. Therefore, this is the only
supported MSA format for now!
.TP
\fB\-\-mis\fR
Output "most informative sequence" instead of
simple consensus  (default=off)
.IP
For each column of the alignment output this is the set of nucleotides with
frequency greater than average in IUPAC notation.
.TP
\fB\-\-covar\fR
Annotate covariance of base pairs in consensus
structure.  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\fR
Produce a colored and structure annotated
alignment in PostScript format in the file
"aln.ps" in the current directory.
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\-EPS\-cols\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Number of columns in colored EPS alignment
output.  (default=`60')
.IP
A value less than 1 indicates that the output should not be wrapped at all.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-layout\-type\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Choose the plotting layout algorithm.
(default=`1')
.IP
Select the layout algorithm that computes the nucleotide coordinates.
Currently, the following algorithms are available:
.IP
0: simple radial layout
.IP
1: Naview layout (Bruccoleri et al. 1988)
.IP
2: circular layout
.IP
3: RNAturtle (Wiegreffe et al. 2018)
.IP
4: RNApuzzler (Wiegreffe et al. 2018)
.TP
\fB\-\-noOptimization\fR
Disable the drawing space optimization of
RNApuzzler.  (default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-ignoreExteriorIntersections\fR
Ignore intersections with the exterior loop
.TP
within the RNA\-tree.
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-ignoreAncestorIntersections\fR
Ignore ancestor intersections within the
.TP
RNA\-tree.
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-ignoreSiblingIntersections\fR
Ignore sibling intersections within the
.TP
RNA\-tree
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-allowFlipping\fR
Allow flipping of exterior loop branches to
resolve exterior branch intersections.
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\-format\fR=\fI\,ps\/\fR|gml|xrna|svg
Specify output format.  (default=`ps')
.IP
Available formats are: PostScript (ps), Graph Meta Language (gml), Scalable
Vector Graphics (svg), and XRNA save file (xrna). Output filenames will end
in ".ps" ".gml" ".svg" ".ss", respectively.
.TP
\fB\-\-pre\fR=\fI\,string\/\fR
Add annotation macros to postscript file, and
add the postscript code in "string" just
before the code to draw the structure. This
is an easy way to add annotation.
.TP
\fB\-\-post\fR=\fI\,string\/\fR
Same as \fB\-\-pre\fR but in contrast to adding the
annotation macros. E.g to mark position 15
with circle use \fB\-\-post\fR "15 cmark".
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNAfold is to automatically determine an ID from the
input sequence data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs
are usually given in the FASTA header of input sequences. If this flag is
active, RNAfold ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and automatically
generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an
increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the
output even if the input has none.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,prefix\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names).  (default=`sequence')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each sequence will be prefixed with the provided
string. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming scheme:
"prefix_xxxx_ss.ps" (secondary structure plot), "prefix_xxxx_dp.ps"
(dot\-plot), "prefix_xxxx_dp2.ps" (stack probabilities), etc. where xxxx is
the sequence number. Note: Setting this parameter implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-delim\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Change the delimiter between prefix and
increasing number for automatically generated
IDs (as used in output file names).
(default=`_')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the default delimiter "_" between
.IP
the prefix string and the increasing number for automatically generated ID.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18]. This option implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated alignment IDs.  (default=`1')
.IP
When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies to ignore any IDs retrieved from the
input data, i.e. it activates the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR flag.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Change the delimiting character that is used
for sanitized filenames
.IP
(default=`ID\-delimiter')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while
sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the
default delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the "ID delimiter" as
supplied through the \fB\-\-id\-delim\fR option. If the delimiter is a whitespace
character or empty, invalid characters will be simply removed rather than
substituted. Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use
in filenames: backslash '\e', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%',
asterisk '*', colon ':', pipe symbol '|', double quote '"', triangular
brackets '<' and '>'.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-full\fR
Use full FASTA header to create filenames.
(default=off)
.IP
This parameter can be used to deactivate the default behavior of limiting
output filenames to the first word of the sequence ID. Consider the following
example: An input with FASTA header ">NM_0001 Homo Sapiens some gene"
usually produces output files with the prefix "NM_0001" without the
additional data available in the FASTA header, e.g. "NM_0001_ss.ps" for
secondary structure plots. With this flag set, no truncation of the output
filenames is done, i.e. output filenames receive the full FASTA header data
as prefixes. Note, however, that invalid characters (such as whitespace) will
be substituted by a delimiting character or simply removed, (see also the
parameter option \fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR).
