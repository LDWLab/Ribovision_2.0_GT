If you wish to contribute to this project, please first discuss any proposed changes with the owners and main developers. You may do that either through making an issue at our official Git\+Hub presence \href{https://github.com/ViennaRNA/ViennaRNA}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Vienna\+RNA/\+Vienna\+RNA}}, by email (\href{mailto:rna@tbi.univie.ac.at}{\texttt{ rna@tbi.\+univie.\+ac.\+at}}), or any other personal communication with the core developer team.

Please note that we have a code of conduct. Please follow it in all your interactions with this project.

\doxysection*{Reporting Bugs}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Please make an issue at Git\+Hub or notify us by emailing to \href{mailto:rna@tbi.univie.ac.at}{\texttt{ rna@tbi.\+univie.\+ac.\+at}}
\item In your report, include as much information as possible, such that we are able to reproduce it. If possible, find a minimal example that triggers the bug.
\item Include the version number for the Vienna\+RNA Package you experience the bug with.
\item Include at least some minimal information regarding your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, etc.)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\doxysection*{Pull Request Process}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Ensure that you have not checked-\/in any files that are automatically build!
\item When contributing C source code, follow our code formatting guide lines. You may use the tool {\ttfamily uncrustify} together with our config located in {\ttfamily misc/uncrustify.\+cfg} to accomplish that.
\item Only expose symbols (functions, variables, etc.) to the libraries interface that are absolutely necessary! Hide all other symbols in the corresponding object file(s) by declaring them as {\ttfamily static}.
\item Use the prefixes {\ttfamily vrna\+\_\+} for any symbol you add to the API of our library! Preprocessor macros in header files require the prefix in capital letters, i.\+e. {\ttfamily VRNA\+\_\+}.
\item Use C-\/style comments at any place necessary to make sure your implementation can still be understood and followed in the future.
\item Add test cases for any new implementation! The test suite is located in the {\ttfamily tests} directory and is split into tests for the C-\/library, executable programs, and the individual scripting language interfaces.
\item Run {\ttfamily make check} to ensure that all other test suites still run properly with your applied changes!
\item When contributing via Git\+Hub, make a personal fork of our project and create a separate branch for your changes. Then make a pull request to our {\ttfamily user-\/contrib} branch. Pull requests to the {\ttfamily master} branch will be rejected to keep its history clean.
\item Pull requests that have been successfully merged into the {\ttfamily user-\/contrib} branch usually find their way into the next release of the Vienna\+RNA Package. However, please note that the core developers may decide to include your changes in a later version.
