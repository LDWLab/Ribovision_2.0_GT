@section rip_intro  

The function of an RNA molecule often depends on its interaction with
other RNAs. The following routines therefore allows one to predict structures
formed by two RNA molecules upon hybridization.

@section  rip_concat   Concatenating RNA sequences

One approach to co-folding two RNAs consists of concatenating the two
sequences and keeping track of the concatenation point in all energy
evaluations. Correspondingly, many of the cofold() and
co_pf_fold() routines take one sequence string as argument
and use the the global variable #cut_point to mark the concatenation
point. Note that while the <i>RNAcofold</i> program uses the '&' character
to mark the chain break in its input, you should not use an '&' when using
the library routines (set #cut_point instead).

@section  rip_stepwise  RNA-RNA interaction as a Stepwise Process

In a second approach to co-folding two RNAs, cofolding is seen as a
stepwise process. In the first step the probability of an unpaired region
is calculated and in a second step this probability of an unpaired region
is  multiplied with the probability of an interaction between the two RNAs.
This approach is implemented for the interaction between a long
target sequence and a short ligand RNA. Function pf_unstru() calculates
the partition function over all unpaired regions in the input
sequence. Function pf_interact(), which calculates the
partition function over all possible interactions between two
sequences, needs both sequence as separate strings as input.
