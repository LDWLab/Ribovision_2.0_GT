This is Version 2.4.18 of the ViennaRNA Package.
------------------------------------------------

The ViennaRNA Package consists of a few stand alone programs and a 
library that you can link your own programs with. The library can
also be accessed through our scripting interfaces for Perl and Python

Together with this version we distribute the Kinfold, RNAforester,
and Kinwalker programs.
