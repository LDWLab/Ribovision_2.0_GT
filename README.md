RiboVision2.0 is open source project available at https://github.com/LDWLab/Ribovision_2.0_GT

## About

RiboVision 2.0  is a webserver designed to visualize phylogenetic and structural information about ribosomal RNA  in multiple dimensions. RiboVision 2.0 is adaptation of previous versions of the web servers RiboVision and RiboVision2, which puts it on par with the previously established visualizer of ribosomal proteins, ProteoVision. RiboVision 2.0 was developed in the Center for Origins of Life (Georgia Tech, Atlanta GA) by Holly McCann and Anton S. Petrov with aid from Ribosome.xyz (
developed at the University of British Columbia by the group of Prof. Khanh Dao-Duc). Please address your questions regarding ProteoVision to RiboZones@gmail.com.
