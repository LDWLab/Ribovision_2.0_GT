v2.0.11
- Fixed reverse complement of IUPAC codes

v2.0.10
- Added new covariance model to detect vertebrate mt-tRNA-Cys without D-arm in
armadillos and some reptiles
- Added MitoHighConfidenceFilter, a post-filtering tool, for annotating 
possible mitochondrial tRNA pseudogenes or extra genes due to duplication events

v2.0.9
- Added option -j or --gff for generating GFF3 output file
- Checked Infernal version compatibilty
- Fixed bug on parsing tRNAscan output in legacy mode

v2.0.8
- Fixed temporary file cleanup process
- Added function declarations for eufind and trnascan to eliminate errors
when building with Xcode 12

v2.0.7
- Fixed positioning when multiple noncanonical introns exist in some 
archaeal tRNAs that may cause incorrect isotype and anticodon annotation
- Handled mt-tRNAs in vertebrates other than mt-tRNA-Ser-GCU that are missing
D-arm
- Added new genetic code file to handle mt-tRNA-Asp in marsupials that have GCC
anticodon

v2.0.6
- Fixed anticodon coordinates when archaeal non-canonical intron locates next 
to anticodon
- Fixed tRNA coordinates when prediction is located at the edge of truncated 
input sequence
- Update archaeal isotype-specific covariance models with more optimal scoring 
for consistent isotype

v2.0.5
- Fixed code for missing tRNA predictions that only occurred when predictions were 
located within 200bp of long stretch of Ns used to connect contigs into scaffolds 
of incomplete genome assemblies

v2.0.4
- Bug fixing for incorrect position of truncated tRNA-fMet in bacterial mode
- Changed isotype and anticodon to Undet/NNN when the prediction matched with   
the tRNA-SeC convariance model but the predicted anticodon was not TCA
- Added code to allow the use of --max option for mitochondrial search mode

v2.0.3
- Added code to adjust anticodon positions for bacterial tRNA-fMet and archaeal 
tRNA-His when the sequences were misaligned with the models

v2.0.2
- Updated code to make thread option consistent with Infernal

v2.0.1
- Updated EukHighConfidenceFilter to flag tRNA-Sup as unexpected anticodon

v2.0
- Major update of tRNAscan-SE
