tRNAscan-SE predicts tRNA genes from input DNA or RNA sequences 
in FASTA format. tRNA predictions are output in standard tabular format,
secondary structure file, FASTA file, BED file, and GTF file.

tRNAscan-SE pioneers the large-scale use of covariance models to
annotate tRNA genes in genomes. A covariance model is an implementation of
a stochastic context-free grammar, able to integrate both primary
sequence and secondary structure information, and is trained on an
aligned, structurally annotated set of RNAs. Any given sequence can be
searched for tRNAs by alignment to a tRNA covariance model. tRNAscan-SE 2.0
combines the use of the latest Infernal v1.1 (1) as the covariance model
search engine and covariance models specifically trained and built
using tRNA sequences from available genomes in the three domains of life
for gene prediction. The method replaces the original use of COVE (2)  
with two prefilters - tRNAscan 1.3 (3) and an implementation of an
algorithm described by Pavesi and colleagues (4) for searching eukaryotic
pol III tRNA promoters (our implementation referred to as EufindtRNA),
which is still available as a backward compatible option. Predicted
tRNA genes will then be assessed using a set of isotype-specific covariance
models. Comparative analysis among these models enables better annotation,
particularly of atypical tRNAs, some of which may produce recoding
events due to mutations in the anticodon. The new tRNAscan-SE also enables
better recognition of tRNA-derived SINEs that are abundant in many
eukaryotic genomes by using a post quality filter.

This distribution includes the source code of tRNAscan-SE, the convariance
models, all the files necessary to compile and run the complete COVE
package (version 2.4.4), all the files necessary to compile and run the modified
version of tRNAscan (version 1.4), and all the files needed to compile
and run eufindtRNA 1.0 (the cove programs, tRNAscan 1.4, and
eufindtRNA are included for use with the tRNAscan-SE program, but may
also be run as stand-alone programs). Installation of the PERL
(Practical Extraction and Report Language, Larry Wall) interpreter
package version 5.0 or later is required to run the tRNAscan-SE PERL
script. Users also need to download and install Infernal before installing
and using tRNAscan-SE. The Infernal source package can be obtained at
http://eddylab.org/infernal/.
