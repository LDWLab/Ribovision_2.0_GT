`ribosensor` combines [`ribotyper`](ribotyper.md#top) and another
program, [`rRNA_sensor`](https://github.com/aaschaffer/rRNA_sensor/blob/master/README)
together to classify and validate ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. It
was designed for screening incoming rRNA sequence submissions to
GenBank. `ribotyper` uses profile HMMs to analyze sequences and
`rRNA_sensor` uses the single-sequence based blastn program to analyze
sequences. The results of both programs are then combined to determine
if a sequence **pass**es or **fail**s.

## `ribosensor` example usage <a name="exampleusage"></a>

This example runs `ribosensor` on a sample file of 16 
sequences.

Move into a directory in which you have write permission and execute
the following command:

```
> ribosensor $RIBOSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/example-16.fa test-rs
```

Like other Ribovore scripts, `ribosensor` takes two required command
line arguments. Optional arguments are explained [below](#options).

The first required argument is the sequence file you want to annotate.
The $RIBOSCRIPTSDIR environment variable should be defined in your
`.bashrc` or `.cshrc` as explained in the [installation
documentation](install.md#environment).

The second required argument is the name of the output subdirectory
that you would like `ribosensor` to create. Output files will be placed
in this output directory. If this directory already exists, the
program will exit with an error message indicating that you need to
either (a) remove the directory before rerunning, or (b) use the -f
option, in which case the directory will be
overwritten.  The command adding `-f` is:

```
> ribosensor -f $RIBOSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/example-16.fa test-rs
```

You should see something like the following output:
```

`ribosensor` outputs information on each step and how long it takes,
followed by a list of output files.

`ribosensor` first runs `ribotyper` as reported in the output:
```
# Running ribotyper on full sequence file                      ... done. [    3.6 seconds]
```

Next, `rRNA_sensor` is executed, up to three times, once for sequences
350 nucleotides or shorter, once for sequences of length between 351
and 600 nucleotides and once for sequences more than 600
nucleotides. For each length range, different `rRNA_sensor` parameters
are used determined to work well for that length range. For this
example, there are zero sequences less than 351 nucleotides so
`rRNA_sensor` is run only twice, as reported in the output:

```
# Running rRNA_sensor on seqs of length 351..600               ... done. [    0.2 seconds]
# Running rRNA_sensor on seqs of length 601..inf               ... done. [    1.7 seconds]
```

Finally, the `ribotyper` and `rRNA_sensor` output is parsed to determine
if each sequence passes or fails each program. Each sequence fails
`ribotyper` if it receives one or more `ribotyper` errors (explained more
[here](#ribotypererrors)) and otherwise passes `ribotyper`.  Each
sequence fails `rRNA_sensor` if it receives one or more `rRNA_sensor`
errors (explained more [here](#rrnasensorerrors)) and otherwise passes
`rRNA_sensor`.

Based on whether it passes or fails each of the two programs, each sequence is assigned
one of four possible 'outcomes':

| `ribotyper` pass or fail? | `rRNA_sensor` pass or fail? | outcome | 
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| PASS                      | PASS                        | RPSP    |
| PASS                      | FAIL                        | RPSF    |
| FAIL                      | PASS                        | RFSP    |
| FAIL                      | FAIL                        | RFSF    |

The counts of sequences for each outcome are output. For the above example the outcome counts are:
```
# Outcome counts:
#
# type   total  pass  indexer  submitter  unmapped
# -----  -----  ----  -------  ---------  --------
  RPSP       8     8        0          0         0
  RPSF       1     1        0          0         0
  RFSP       0     0        0          0         0
  RFSF       7     0        0          7         0
#
  *all*     16     9        0          7         0
```

The 'pass' column indicates how many sequences in each outcome class 'pass' `ribosensor`.
All RPSP sequences pass `ribosensor`. Some RPSF and RFSP sequences also pass `ribosensor`
as explained more below. All RFSF sequences fail `ribosensor`.

The `ribosensor` output also includes `Per-program error counts:`:
```
# Per-program error counts:
#
#                      number   fraction
# error                of seqs   of seqs
# -------------------  -------  --------
  CLEAN                      8   0.50000
  S_NoHits                   1   0.06250
  S_TooLong                  1   0.06250
  S_LowScore                 5   0.31250
  S_LowSimilarity            5   0.31250
  R_NoHits                   1   0.06250
  R_UnacceptableModel        5   0.31250
  R_LowCoverage              1   0.06250
```

The `CLEAN` row pertains to the RPSP sequences which had zero errors
in both `ribotyper` and `rRNA_sensor`. The remaining rows are for
`rRNA_sensor` errors (those beginning with `S_`) and
`ribotyper` errors (those beginning with `R_`), and are explained in the sections below
on [`rRNA_sensor` errors](#rrnasensorerrors) and [`ribotyper` errors](#ribotypererrors).

Finally, information on the number of GenBank errors is output:
```
# GENBANK error counts:
#
#                                number   fraction
# error                          of seqs   of seqs
# -----------------------------  -------  --------
  CLEAN                                9   0.56250
  SEQ_HOM_NotSSUOrLSUrRNA              1   0.06250
  SEQ_HOM_LowSimilarity                1   0.06250
  SEQ_HOM_LengthLong                   1   0.06250
  SEQ_HOM_TaxNotExpectedSSUrRNA        5   0.31250
  SEQ_HOM_LowCoverage                  1   0.06250
```

GenBank errors are determined by combining the `ribotyper` and `rRNA_sensor` errors as explained [here](#genbankerrors).

## `rRNA_sensor` errors in `ribosensor` <a name="rrnasensorerrors"></a>

Any sequence that receives one or more `rRNA_sensor` errors will be considered to have failed `rRNA_sensor`.

The possible `rRNA_sensor` errors are listed in the table below, along with the [GenBank errors](#genbankerrors) they associate with.

| `rRNA_sensor` error    | associated GenBank error |  cause/explanation  |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
|S_NoHits*             | SEQ_HOM_NotSSUOrLSUrRNA  | no hits reported ('no' in column 2) | 
|S_NoSimilarity*       | SEQ_HOM_LowSimilarity    | coverage (column 5) of best blast hit is < 10% |
|S_LowSimilarity*      | SEQ_HOM_LowSimilarity    | coverage (column 5) of best blast hit is < 80% (is seq len <= 350 nt) or < 86% (if seq len > 350 nt) |
|S_LowScore*           | SEQ_HOM_LowSimilarity    | either id percentage below length-dependent threshold (75%,80%,86%) or E-value above 1e-40 ('imperfect_match` in column 2) |
|S_BothStrands         | SEQ_HOM_MisAsBothStrands | hits on both strands ('mixed' in column 2) |
|S_MultipleHits        | SEQ_HOM_MultipleHits     | more than 1 hit reported (column 4 value > 1) |

As an exception, the first four `rRNA_sensor` errors (labelled with '*') do not trigger a GenBank error
and so are ignored by `ribosensor` (and so do not cause a sequence to fail `ribosensor`)
if either (a) the sequence is 'RPSF' (passes `ribotyper` and fails `rRNA_sensor`) and
the `-c` option is *not* used with `ribosensor` or (b)
the sequence is 'RFSF' (fails both `ribotyper` and `rRNA_sensor`) and
R_UnacceptableModel or R_QuestionableModel `ribotyper` errors are also reported.

## `ribotyper` errors in `ribosensor` <a name="ribotypererrors"></a>

`ribotyper` detects and reports up to 15 different types (depending on
command-line arguments) of 'unexpected_features' for each sequence, as
explained more [here](#ribotyper.md:unexpectedfeatures). In the
context of `ribosensor`, 10 of these 15 types are detected by `ribosensor`
and cause a sequence to fail `ribotyper`. They are listed below along
with the [GenBank errors](#genbankerrors) they associate with.

| `ribotyper` error          | associated GenBank error         | cause/explanation | 
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| R_NoHits                 | SEQ_HOM_NotSSUOrLSUrRNA          | no hits reported |
| R_MultipleFamilies       | SEQ_HOM_SSUAndLSUrRNA            | SSU and LSU hits |
| R_LowScore               | SEQ_HOM_LowSimilarity            | bits/position score is < 0.5 |
| R_BothStrands            | SEQ_HOM_MisAsBothStrands         | hits on both strands |
| R_InconsistentHits       | SEQ_HOM_MisAsHitOrder            | hits are in different order in sequence and model |
| R_DuplicateRegion        | SEQ_HOM_MisAsDupRegion           | hits overlap by 10 or more model positions |
| R_UnacceptableModel      | SEQ_HOM_TaxNotExpectedSSUrRNA    | best hit is to model other than expected set; 16S expected set: SSU.Archaea, SSU.Bacteria, SSU.Cyanobacteria, SSU.Chloroplast; 18S expected set: SSU.Eukarya; |
| R_LowCoverage            | SEQ_HOM_LowCoverage              | coverage of all hits is < 0.80 (if <= 350nt) or 0.86 (if > 350nt) |
| R_QuestionableModel+    | SEQ_HOM_TaxQuestionableSSUrRNA   | best hit is to a 'questionable' model (if mode is 16S: SSU.Chloroplast, if mode is 18S, does not apply) | 
| R_MultipleHits+         | SEQ_HOM_MultipleHits             | more than 1 hit reported | 

As an exception, the final two errors (labelled with '+') do not trigger a GenBank error
and so are ignored by `ribosensor` (and so do not cause a sequence to fail `ribosensor`) 
if the sequence is 'RFSP' (fails `ribotyper` but passes `rRNA_sensor`).

## GenBank errors in `ribosensor` <a name="genbankerrors"></a>

A sequence fails `ribosensor` if it has one or more GenBank errors. Each GenBank error is
triggered by one or more `rRNA_sensor` and/or `ribotyper` errors as shown in the table below:

| GenBank error                   |  triggering `rRNA_sensor`/`ribotyper` errors | 
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| SEQ_HOM_NotSSUOrLSUrRNA         | S_NoHits*, R_NoHits |
| SEQ_HOM_LowSimilarity           | S_NoSimilarity*, S_LowSimilarity*, S_LowScore*, R_LowScore |
| SEQ_HOM_SSUAndLSUrRNA           | R_MultipleFamilies |
| SEQ_HOM_MisAsBothStrands        | S_BothStrands, R_BothStrands |
| SEQ_HOM_MisAsHitOrder           | R_InconsistentHits |
| SEQ_HOM_MisAsDupRegion          | R_DuplicateRegion |
| SEQ_HOM_TaxNotExpectedSSUrRNA   | R_UnacceptableModel |
| SEQ_HOM_TaxQuestionableSSUrRNA  | R_QuestionableModel+ |
| SEQ_HOM_LowCoverage             | R_LowCoverage |
| SEQ_HOM_MultipleHits            | S_MultipleHits, R_MultipleHits+ |

There are two classes of exceptions in the above table marked by two different
superscripts in the table: '*': these `rRNA_sensor` errors do not
trigger a GenBank error if: (a) the sequence is 'RPSF' (passes
`ribotyper` and fails `rRNA_sensor`) and the `-c` option is
*not* used with `ribosensor` or (b) the sequence is 'RFSF'
(fails both `ribotyper` and `rRNA_sensor`) and R_UnacceptableModel or
R_QuestionableModel are also reported. '+': these `ribotyper` errors do
not trigger a GenBank error if sequence is 'RFSP' (fails `ribotyper` but
passes `rRNA_sensor`).

## <a name="options"></a>Using `ribosensor` for 18S eukaryotic SSU rRNA sequences

The above example run on the `example-16.fa` file runs `ribosensor` in
its default *mode* for validation of 16S SSU rRNA sequences from
bacteria or archaea. Alterntatively, `ribosensor` can be run in 18S mode
to validate 18S SSU rRNA eukaryotic sequences using the command line
option `-m 18S`. For example, we can run `ribosensor` on the same input file
in 18S mode with the following command:

```
> ribosensor -m 18S $RIBOSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/example-16.fa test-rs
```

In this case, only 4 sequences pass. These are 4 of the 16 sequences in the input
file which are eukaryotic SSU sequences:

```
# GPIPE error counts:
#
#                                number   fraction
# error                          of seqs   of seqs
# -----------------------------  -------  --------
  CLEAN                                4   0.25000
  SEQ_HOM_NotSSUOrLSUrRNA              1   0.06250
  SEQ_HOM_LengthLong                   1   0.06250
  SEQ_HOM_TaxNotExpectedSSUrRNA       10   0.62500
  SEQ_HOM_LowCoverage                  1   0.06250
```

Currently, 16S (default) and 18S are the only two available modes, but we hope to
add additional modes in the future. Contact me at eric.nawrocki@nih.gov if there's a
specific mode you'd like to request.

## <a name="blastdb"></a>`rRNA_sensor` blastn databases

`rRNA_sensor` includes two blastn databases: one with 1267 sequences for
16S SSU rRNA (archaeal and bacterial) and one with 1091 sequences for
eukaryotic 18S SSU rRNA. These were created by clustering larger
datasets and only keeping one sequence from each cluster as described
more in the Ribovore 1.0 paper. Following Ribovore installation, the
FASTA files for these databases will be available here:

```
$RIBOINSTALLDIR/rRNA_sensor/16S_centroids.fa
$RIBOINSTALLDIR/rRNA_sensor/18S_centroids.1091.fa 
```
---

## <a name="modelinfo"></a> `ribosensor` modelinfo files

The default `ribosensor` modelinfo file is in `$RIBOSCRIPTSDIR/models/ribosensor.modelinfo`:

```
> cat $RIBOSCRIPTSDIR/models/ribosensor.modelinfo
# Model info file for ribosensor.
# Contains information on name of modelinfo file and accept
# file to use with ribotyper and BLAST database to use 
# with rRNA_sensor.
# 
# Each non-# prefixed line has 4 tokens, separated by a space.
# First token is a shorthand name for a mode, these are acceptable
#   arguments to the ribosensor -m option.
# Second token is the rRNA_sensor BLAST DB name for that mode.
# Third token is the ribotyper modelinfo file name for that mode.
# Fourth token is the ribotyper accept file name for that mode.
16S 16S_centroids      ribotyper.modelinfo ribosensor.ssu-arc-bac.accept
18S 18S_centroids.1091 ribotyper.modelinfo ribosensor.ssu-euk.accept
```

If the `-i` option is ***not*** used, then the `ribotyper` modelinfo
file and `ribotyper` *accept* file must exist in the default model
directory (`$RIBOSCRIPTSDIR/models/`). If `-i <s>` is used then
`ribosensor` will first look for the `ribotyper` modelinfo and accept
models in the default model directory, if it finds files with the
names specified in the `ribosensor` modelinfo file then it will use
those, if not it will then look for the `ribotyper` modelinfo and
accept models in the same directory as the file supplied with the `-i`
option. If the files are still not found, `ribosensor` will exit
in error.

Currently, the only two blast databases included with `rRNA_sensor`
are `16S_centroids` and `18S_centroids.1091`, so these are the only
two blast databases `ribosensor` can be used with. We hope to add more
in the future. You can construct your own. Email eric.nawrocki@nih.gov
to request a specific gene/tax group for a future release or for help
creating your own.

The `ribosensor.modelinfo` file is the only `ribosensor` modelinfo
file provided with Ribovore, but you can create additional files by
copying it and modifying it as necessary.

For more information on `ribotyper` modelinfo files, see
[here](ribotyper.md#library).  For more information on `ribotyper`
accept files, see [here](ribotyper.md#acceptable).

Usage: ribosensor [-options] <fasta file to annotate> <output directory>

basic options:
  -f           : force; if <output directory> exists, overwrite it
  -m <s>       : set mode to <s>, possible <s> values are "16S" and "18S" [16S]
  -c           : assert that sequences are from cultured organisms
  -n <n>       : use <n> CPUs [0]
  -v           : be verbose; output commands to stdout as they're run
  -i <s>       : use model info file <s> instead of default
  --keep       : keep all intermediate files that are removed by default
  --skipsearch : skip search stages, use results from earlier run

rRNA_sensor related options:
  --Sminlen <n>    : set rRNA_sensor minimum sequence length to <n> [100]
  --Smaxlen <n>    : set rRNA_sensor minimum sequence length to <n> [2000]
  --Smaxevalue <x> : set rRNA_sensor maximum E-value to <x> [1e-40]
  --Sminid1 <n>    : set rRNA_sensor minimum percent id for seqs <= 350 nt to <n> [75]
  --Sminid2 <n>    : set rRNA_sensor minimum percent id for seqs [351..600] nt to <n> [80]
  --Sminid3 <n>    : set rRNA_sensor minimum percent id for seqs > 600 nt to <n> [86]
  --Smincovall <n> : set rRNA_sensor minimum coverage for all sequences to <n> [10]
  --Smincov1 <n>   : set rRNA_sensor minimum coverage for seqs <= 350 nt to <n> [80]
  --Smincov2 <n>   : set rRNA_sensor minimum coverage for seqs  > 350 nt to <n> [86]

options for saving sequence subsets to files:
  --psave : save passing sequences to a file

options for parallelizing cmsearch on a compute farm:
  -p         : parallelize ribotyper and rRNA_sensor on a compute farm
  -q <s>     : use qsub info file <s> instead of default
  -s <n>     : seed for random number generator is <n> [181]
  --nkb <n>  : number of KB of sequence for each farm job is <n> [100]
  --wait <n> : allow <n> wall-clock minutes for jobs on farm to finish, including queueing time [500]
  --errcheck : consider any farm stderr output as indicating a job failure
```
